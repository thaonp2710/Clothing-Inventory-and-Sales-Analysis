# Clothing-Inventory-and-Sales-Analysis
Managing inventory has always been a pressing challenge for retailers in general, and for clothing
retailers in particular. The findings in this project suggest that the problems clothing retailers are experiencing with managing their inventory volume not only from the amount of sales they are generating but also from when the efficiency of decisions surrounding that inventory have been made which are related to demand.

This research project aims to improve the understanding of how clothing retailers make inventory
decisions that impact both sales performance and operational efficiency. Retailers invest a significant
amount of money in their inventory, and making poor timing decisions regarding inventory may lead
retailers to incur additional holding costs, aggressive markdowns, and lose revenue opportunities due to
lack of stock on-hand. The goal of this project is to provide valuable, actionable insight and analysis to
clothing retailers on how they can make better informed decisions regarding inventory.
